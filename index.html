      <h1>Comparing images and videos with splits</h1>

      <h2>Basics</h2>

      <p>
      The comparison of elements is handled by inserting a div with class
      compare in the document. No need to specify anything else, the javascript
      will take care of resizing it to the content. Inside this compare div, the
      compared elements can be either videos or images. They must be given the
      compared class.
      </p>

      <h2>Comparing two images</h2>

      <p>
      When comparing images, add two images in the compare div with class
      compare. One image must be given class compared-left, the other one
      compared right. A label can be given to the images using a data-compare
      attribute.
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;div class="compare"&gt;
  &lt;img class="compared compared-left" data-compare="standard" src="single-012.png"/&gt;
  &lt;img class="compared compared-right" data-compare="ours" src="multi-012.png"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      </pre>

      <div class="compare">
        <img class="compared compared-left" data-compare="standard" src="standard.png"/>
        <img class="compared compared-right" data-compare="ours" src="ours.png"/>
      </div>

      <h2>Comparing videos</h2>

      <p>
      Although videos could be compared as images with two videos, one
      compared-left and the other one compared-right, if the videos are to be
      kept synchronize, the above method will not work since frames can be
      arbitrarily dropped independently on the videos, and actively maintaining
      the synchronization is difficult. The alternative is to avoid
      synchronization by using one single video.  Take the two videos, and
      create a new video merging both side by side, either vertically or
      horizontally.  If the two videos are stacked vertically, add the video
      with classes compared and compared-vertical in the compare div. For
      horizontal side by side, use compared-horizontal.  Labels can be given
      using data-compare-top and data-compare-bottom attributes (vertical case)
      or data-compare-left and data-compare-right (horizontal case). The video
      should probably also be given loop and autoplay attributes, and muted
      since some browsers prevent the autoplay of unmuted videos (thank them).
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;div class="compare"&gt;
  &lt;video 
    class="compared compared-vertical" 
    data-compare-top="standard"
    data-compare-bottom="ours"
    loop muted autoplay
    &gt;
    &lt;source src="barber.webm" type="video/webm"&gt;
    &lt;source src="barber.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a &lt;a href="barber.mp4"&gt;link to the video&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      </pre>

      <div class="compare">
        <video 
          class="compared compared-vertical" 
          data-compare-top="standard"
          data-compare-bottom="ours"
          loop muted autoplay
          >
          <source src="barber.webm" type="video/webm">
          <source src="barber.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="barber.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
        </video>
      </div>

      <h2>Styling</h2>

      <p>
      Styling is done through CSS. The important parts are that compare class
      should have position relative since the magnifier placement depends on
      that. The compared class should be hidden, since a canvas will be added,
      and the compared elements will be splat on it. Its positioning is set to
      absolute to remove it from the document flow, and prevent it from
      occupying space. The magnifiers should be absolutely positioned. Their
      size and shape is controlled with css. Round magnifiers can be obtained
      using equal width and height, and a border-radius of half that size. The
      overflow should be hidden to crop the (square) contained canvas to the
      rounded corners. Do as you wish for the rest.
      </p>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="compare.js"></script>
